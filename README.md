# hello-world
This is a tutorial reposity

The creator of this practice git is Raffy Lavilles. This is to create an experience of using github to learn how it works. I will use this to teach others and works on my personal project too.

Good luck to me. 

This editing is the second part.

The content of the second edit is different from the first branch. This is about by degree rather than personal life in the first part. My bachelor degree is Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Major in Information Systems 

This editing part is for experiences

The working experience of raffy starts as an OJT at the library of CBA Library.
